                            <p>Disciple is a SaaS product that lets community leaders create their own independent community platform on web, iOS and Android. I was heavily involved in improving the marketing websites user experience.</p>

                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>The sales team had expressed concern that website users who had converted into leads did not actually understand what Disciple was. This meant that sales representatives were spending a considerable amount of time explaining what the product was, instead of selling it.</p>

                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <p>I conducted a usability test to understand why users were having difficulty understanding Disciple’s purpose. My findings allowed me to make recommendations on how to improve the user’s ability to see the purpose of Disciple and perceive it as a valuable product.</p>

                            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p>So far, my recommendations have led to a 24% increase in conversions, showing that users better understand the product and its value. The sales team is also spending far less time explaining the product to leads, so they can focus on selling it instead.</p>

                            <h2>Usability test</h2>
                            <p>Due to budgetary and time constraints, the test had to be conducted remotely using a platform called User Brain. I used it to set up the usability test and recruit ten participants from a worldwide pool of testers. I also wrote a “script” for these participants which would guide them through the test in the absence of a facilitator.</p>

                            <p>Three out of ten participants successfully demonstrated a good understanding of Disciple, but only after reading through all of the text on the home and “How it works” pages. This showed that at a glance, the website did not successfully convey Disciple’s purpose, requiring users to invest time into reading all the text to gain a good understanding.</p>

                            <p>Because it was difficult to find out what Disciple was, the product also did not resonate with several participants as valuable.

                            <p>On the homepage, key visual information above the fold was hidden within an outdated explainer video that very few users were watching. I proposed to replace this with a visual that immediately shows a real example of a community platform that had been built with Disciple.</p>
                            <p>A genuine example of what can be done with Disciple would help users visualise the product and therefore understand its purpose. Presenting it as a case study would also act as social proof, persuading them that Disciple is a product with value, that its customers have found success using.</p>

While this would take longer than anyone had desired, this was to ensure that none of them would have a significantly negative impact and make the others look unsuccessful. As of my departure from Disciple, my first recommendation had been launched, resulting in a 24% increase in conversions. I am confident that the other improvements will yield similar results.</p>
