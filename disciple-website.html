                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Disciple’s marketing website had previously been built using solely quantitative data obtained from analytics and A/B tests. These methods gave a good idea of the success of every iteration (in terms of numbers) but did not give any insight into the thoughts and feelings of visitors or their perception of Disciple.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <p>With approval from the key stakeholders, I took it upon myself to conduct qualitative research to take a more human centred approach to improving the website. Based on the results, I made recommendations for improvements that would enhance the visitor’s perception and understanding of Disciple.</p>

                            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p>My recommendations improved the success rate of in usability tests to 100%. As a result, they are currently being implemented into the website. So far, the first has been fully implemented and has increased the conversion rate by 24%. User research was also embedded into the overall design process.</p>

                            <h2>Usability test</h2>
                            <p>Due to time constraints, it was decided that I should focus my efforts on the homepage and landing pages. This was because quantitative data showed that only a small percentage of traffic went through other parts of the website. Additionally, the homepage and landing pages shared almost identical content and structure, with the only variation being in copy. This meant that any improvement to the homepage would translate to the landing pages.</p>
                            <p>The tests were conducted remotely, using “Userbrain” to recruit ten participants. Half of these participants used mobile devices while the others were on desktop. Participants were given access to a landing page that was fully identical to the homepage and asked to complete several activities using the content available to them. Navigation was disabled so that they could not access other parts of the website.</p>

                            <p>My first recommendation was to bring key visual content out of the explainer video in the top fold of the homepage, replacing it with a more concise product visual. Another designer took this further, suggesting we use a real example of a community platform that had been built with Disciple.</p>
                            <p>Using a genuine example of a community platform in action would help visitors visualise the product and therefore understand its purpose. It would also act as social proof, persuading them that Disciple is a valuable product that has made its customers successful.</p>

                            <p>Disciple was also undergoing a large scale rebrand at the same time as this project. Thanks to the branding team, the visual quality website was greatly improved. This would improve first impressions by representing Disciple as an established and valuable product.</p>

                            <p>The product visuals on the homepage consisted of out of date low-quality GIFs. Higher quality and up to date visuals would be more engaging and more informative to visitors. I therefore created a new set of animated visuals that gave a quick tour of key product features. These were exported as videos rather than GIFs to meet modern standards and help improve page load speed once implemented.</p>
