                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Disciple’s marketing website had previously been built using solely quantitative data obtained from analytics and A/B tests. These methods gave a good idea of the success of every iteration (in terms of numbers) but did not give any insight into the thoughts and feelings of visitors or their perception of Disciple.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <p>With approval from the key stakeholders, I took it upon myself to conduct user research, taking a more human centred approach to improving the website. Based on the results, I made recommendations for improvements that would enhance the visitor’s perception and understanding of Disciple.</p>

                            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p>My recommendations improved the success rate of usability tests to 100%. As a result, they are currently being implemented onto the website. So far, the first improvement has increased the conversion rate by 24%. The results also led to user research being embedded into the design process, a huge win for Disciple, its customers, and their end-users.</p>

                            <h2>Campaigning for UX</h2>
                            <p>The first challenge was to persuade Disciple’s upper management to approve the conduction of user research. Their concern was the time and money required to conduct the research without the guarantee of success. Ultimately, a compromise was made, which would be an opportunity to prove the value of conducting user research in the design and development process.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that I should focus my efforts on the homepage as a proof of concept. This page was chosen because existing data showed that very few visitors accessed went to the other pages before either converting or leaving the website. Therefore, the homepage was deemed the most important page to improve for this project.</p>

                            <h2>Usability test</h2>
                            <p>I started by conducting two usability tests. This was to gain insight into the thoughts and feelings of visitors while interacting with the website and to identify any issues that inhibited them from completing key tasks. Both tests were conducted remotely, using “Userbrain” to recruit five participants each. The tasks they were given were also identical.</p>

                            <p>The difference was that the first test gave participants access to the entire website, while in the second test only the homepage was accessible. The intention behind the first test was to identify any content within other pages that effectively helped participants complete the tasks. This content could then be used to inform that on the homepage. At the same time, I wanted to see how successful the homepage alone was in helping the participants complete their tasks, allowing me to determine which areas could be improved.</p>

                            <p>My first recommendation was to bring key visual content out of the explainer video in the top fold of the homepage, replacing it with a more concise product visual. Another designer took this further, suggesting we use a real example of a community platform that had been built with Disciple.</p>
                            <p>Using a genuine example of a community platform in action would help visitors visualise the product and therefore understand its purpose. It would also act as social proof, persuading them that Disciple is a valuable product that has made its customers successful.</p>

                            <p>Disciple was also undergoing a large scale rebrand at the same time as this project. Thanks to the branding team, the visual quality website was greatly improved. This would improve first impressions by representing Disciple as an established and valuable product.</p>

                            <p>The product visuals on the homepage consisted of out of date low-quality GIFs. Higher quality and up to date visuals would be more engaging and more informative to visitors. I therefore created a new set of animated visuals that gave a quick tour of key product features. These were exported as videos rather than GIFs to meet modern standards and help improve page load speed once implemented.</p>

                            <p>Although the top fold copy was out of scope for now, we could still improve the rest of the copy to be easier to digest. One idea was to present key information in short bullet points to accompany the new product visuals, rather than lengthy paragraphs. It is worth noting that the existing copy had been carefully crafted by the marketing team to optimise SEO. Therefore, it is important that design and marketing work together to find the best solution.</p>
