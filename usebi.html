                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>As of January 2020, UK households generate a total of 4.5m tonnes of food waste each year. This amounts to £14bn worth of food and a severe environmental impact. How can I help people reduce the amount the food waste they produce? I started this passion project to try and solve the problem.</p>
                            <h2>Solution</h2>
                            <p>Usebi lets home cooks create an inventory of all their food and leftovers, including expiry dates. Push notifications remind them of food that is close to expiring, allowing them to eat or use it before it goes off and has to be thrown away.</p>
                            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p>Participants in the final usability test successfully completed 90% of the tasks with little or no difficulty. Usebi as a concept and product was also well received by all but one of the participants in both usability tests, indicating a strong product market fit.</p>

Both are placed in separate categories, accessible via tabs in the top navigation bar. This makes it easier to navigate the inventory and makes its contents easier to digest (no pun intended). Users can also search and filter their inventory to check for individual or groups of items.</p>

                            <p>The type of expiry date determines what is advised if the food expires. With “use by” dates, expired food should be thrown away because it could be dangerous to eat. For “best before” dates, the food is still safe to eat, but should be eaten as soon as possible before its quality deteriorates any further.</p>

                            <p>Because leftovers do not have set expiry dates, when they expire is determined by their storage. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-store-food-and-leftovers/" target="_blank">According to the NHS</a>, refrigerated leftovers should be eaten within 2 days. Frozen leftovers last indefinitely, but should be eaten as soon as possible after 3 months because they will begin to deteriorate in quality.</p>

From 103 vetted respondents, I found that:</p>

                            <p>Based on the design goals above, I began exploring ideas for the product. I then narrowed them down to one key concept. This concept will allow Fred to create an inventory of the food and leftovers in his kitchen and <span class="highlight">help him keep track of them</span>. Push notifications will <span class="highlight">remind him</span> of any that are close to expiring, allowing him to <span class="highlight">use them before they go off</span> and have to be thrown away.</p>
                            <p>Focusing on this one concept ensured that the first iteration of the project could be completed within the timeframe I had set. I chose this one over the others because it addressed all three design goals, while still being one of the most feasible. The other ideas could then be added with future iterations if they make the cut.</p>

                            <p>The aim of the visual design was for it to loosely resemble a modern home kitchen, making the user feel at home when using the product. For example, all corners are slightly rounded to resemble the bevelled corners of kitchen counters. The primary colour draws the user’s attention to key elements and was inspired by the more vibrant kitchens that utilise shades of teal and green. To ensure the product was usable by anyone, I prioritised accessibility over aesthetics where necessary for elements like text sizing, colour contrast and target sizes.</p>

I designed the illustration style to use simple shapes, consisting only of shades of green, orange and white. This was to make them consistent with the rest of the UI, but also make it quick and easy to reproduce their style whenever new ones are required.</p>

                            <p>Working on this project helped me learn more about conducting user research. Doing so allowed me to create a user centred experience that helps solve a large scale problem. It also reaffirmed that designing solutions solely based on assumptions should be avoided, as my initial idea before conducting research would have only solved a small part of the problem.</p>
                            <p>It is worth mentioning that I used a platform called Userbrain to conduct the usability tests. I chose this method because it allowed me to validate the prototypes quickly at a relatively low cost in the middle of a global pandemic. In the future I would like to use more conventional methods to gather more reliable data.</p>
                            <p>The next step I would like to take is to include an onboarding flow that introduces the product to new users. This will most likely guide them through adding their first food item to the inventory. Following that I plan to explore the following:</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Inventory improvements:</span> At the moment there are two categories. However, the “Food” category could (and probably should) be split into several more to make it easier to sort and navigate. “Ingredients,” “Beverages” and “Read meals” are examples of possible candidates.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Scanning:</span> the ability to scan food items into the inventory would automate the process and make it much easier for the user. First, I will need to look into what sort of information stored within bar codes to see if this idea is feasible.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Recipes:</span> another idea I have is similar a traditional recipe app. It would allow users to upload and share recipes that use up leftovers as well as ingredients. These recipes could even be filtered based on the food and leftovers in each user’s inventory.</p>
