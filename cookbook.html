                        <p>CookBook is my final year project for my Digital Arts degree at the University of Kent&#46; It is a website that aims to teach its users the basics of cooking through engaging graphics and animations&#46;</p>

                            <h3>Brief</h3>
                            <p>Given the scale of cooking&#44; it was unrealistic to cover all aspects of cooking and complete the project within its timeframe&#46; Therefore&#44; it was necessary to determine a target user group for the project to tailor the content to&#46;</p>
                            <p>University is a stage in many adults lives where they are independent for the first time&#46; This also means that many are new to cooking as well&#46; The purpose of the website would be to teach these students the basics of cooking&#44; providing them with a foundation to learn more&#46;</p>

                            <h3>Branding</h3>
                            <p>The logo was the first thing to be designed&#44; starting with several ideas being brainstormed on paper&#46; The aim was to create an attractive&#44; minimalistic logo that reflected CookBook as a brand&#46; This led to the idea of a chef&#39;s hat rising out of an open book&#46; This was coupled with a versatile sans&#45;serif typeface that was used for the all text throughout the website&#46;</p>
                            <p>Chestnut brown was chosen as the primary colour and inspired by popular foods such as cooked meat and chocolate&#46; Green made for an effective accent colour&#44; given its association with healthy food&#46; The last three colours &#40;on the right&#41; were used exclusively for the video sections to distinguish them others&#46;</p>
                            <p>When designing this colour scheme&#44; emphasis was placed on ensuring that the foreground and background colours contrasted adequately according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&#46; This guaranteed the visibility of important elements to all users&#44; including those who are colour blind&#46;</p>

                            <p>The site map allowed me to determine the structure of the website and how each page would relate to one another&#46; The website was ultimately organised into three categories&#46; This was also the first opportunity to decide which labels to use for each page&#44; allowing the user to easily navigate throughout the site&#46;</p>

                            <p>A mobile first approach was taken when designing the layout&#46; When drawing the wireframes&#44; it became clear that many pages would share the same layout&#46; Therefore&#44; detailed wireframes were drawn for each possible section that could be included within a page&#46; This provided a set of &#39;building blocks&#39; from which the layouts of each page could be designed&#44; allowing for a more efficient design workflow when designing each individual page&#46;</p>

                            <p>For CookBook to be successful in teaching it users&#44; it had to be engaging&#46; This was achieved using 3D graphics and animations which were created using Autodesk Maya and After Effects&#46; These 3D graphics are cel-shaded&#44; giving them a unique cartoon appearance&#46; This distinguishes CookBook from other cooking websites&#44; the majority of which use photography&#46; This art style is also present in animated tutorials featured throughout the site&#46; These animations were created to cover the more complex topics and provide an engaging means of learning beyond textual content&#46;</p>
