                    <p>CookBook is my final year project for my Digital Arts degree at the University of Kent&#46; It is a website that teaches its users the basics of cooking through the use of 3D animations and graphics&#44; as well as concise textual information&#46;</p>

                   <h2>Branding</h2>
                    <p class="text-left">University is a stage in many young people&#39;s lives where they are likely to be cooking for themselves for the first time&#46; It was therefore decided for university students to be primary target audience for the website&#46; With this in mind&#44; work began with the establishment of a brand&#46;</p>
                    <p class="text-left">The logo was the first thing to be designed&#44; starting with several ideas being brainstormed on paper&#46; The aim was to create an attractive&#44; minimalistic logo that reflected CookBook as a brand&#46; This led to the idea of a chef&#39;s hat rising out of an open book&#46; This was coupled with a versatile sans&#45;serif typeface that was used for the all text throughout the website&#46;</p>

                    <p>Chestnut brown was chosen as the primary colour and inspired by popular foods such as cooked meat and chocolate&#46; Green made for an effective accent colour&#44; given its association with healthy food&#46; The last three colours &#40;on the right&#41; were used exclusively for the video sections in order to distinguish them others&#46;</p>
                    <p>When designing this colour scheme&#44; emphasis was placed on ensuring that the foreground and background colours contrasted adequately according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&#46; This guaranteed the visibility of important elements to all users&#44; including those who are colour blind&#46;</p>

                    <p>With the brand of the website established&#44; the next stage was to design it&#39;s structure&#46; A site map was created in order to determined how content would be organised and the relationship each page had with one another&#46; Ultimately&#44; the website&#39;s main content was organised under three categories&#46;</p>
                    <p>A mobile first approach was taken when designing the layouts of the website. When drawing the wireframes, it became clear that many of the pages would share very similar layouts. Therefore, detailed wireframes were drawn for each possible section that could be included within a page. This provided a set of ‘building blocks’ from which the layouts of each page could be designed, allowing for a more efficient design workflow.</p>

                    <p>All visuals throughout the site were created in 3D using Maya&#46; These 3D graphics are cel&#45;shaded&#44; giving them a unique cartoon appearance&#46; This distinguishes CookBook from other cooking websites&#44; the vast majority of which use photography&#46; This art style is also present in animated tutorials featured throughout the site&#46; These animations were created to cover the more complex topics and provide an engaging means of learning beyond textual content&#46;</p>
