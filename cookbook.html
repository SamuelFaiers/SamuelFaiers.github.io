                            <p>CookBook is a website that teaches students the basics of cooking through engaging 3D graphics. This was my final year project for my degree in Digital Arts.</p>

                            <h2>Brief</h2>
                            <p>Given the scale of cooking, it was unrealistic to cover all aspects of cooking and complete the project within its timeframe. Therefore, it was necessary to determine a target user group for the project to tailor the content to.</p>
                            <p>University is a stage in many adults lives where they are independent for the first time. This also means that many are new to cooking as well. The purpose of the website would be to teach these students the basics of cooking, providing them with a foundation to learn more.</p>

                            <h2>Branding</h2>
                            <p>The logo was the first thing to be designed, starting with several ideas being brainstormed on paper. The aim was to create an attractive, minimalistic logo that reflected CookBook as a brand. This led to the idea of a chef's hat rising out of an open book. This was coupled with a versatile sans-serif typeface that was used for the all text throughout the website.</p>
                            <p>Chestnut brown was chosen as the primary colour and inspired by popular foods such as cooked meat and chocolate. Green made for an effective accent colour, given its association with healthy food. The last three colours &#40;on the right&#41; were used exclusively for the video sections to distinguish them others.</p>
                            <p>When designing this colour scheme, emphasis was placed on ensuring that the foreground and background colours contrasted adequately according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This guaranteed the visibility of important elements to all users, including those who are colour blind.</p>

                            <p>The site map allowed me to determine the structure of the website and how each page would relate to one another. The website was ultimately organised into three categories. This was also the first opportunity to decide which labels to use for each page, allowing the user to easily navigate throughout the site.</p>

                            <p>A mobile first approach was taken when designing the layout. When drawing the wireframes, it became clear that many pages would share the same layout. Therefore, detailed wireframes were drawn for each possible section that could be included within a page. This provided a set of "building blocks" from which the layouts of each page could be designed, allowing for a more efficient design workflow when designing each individual page.</p>

                            <p>For CookBook to be successful in teaching it users, it had to be engaging. This was achieved using 3D graphics and animations which were created using Autodesk Maya and After Effects. These 3D graphics are cel-shaded, giving them a unique cartoon appearance. This distinguishes CookBook from other cooking websites, the majority of which use photography. This art style is also present in animated tutorials featured throughout the site. These animations were created to cover the more complex topics and provide an engaging means of learning beyond textual content.</p>
