                        <p>This project began with my initial research into the subject where I found that there is concern within the jazz community about its aging audience&#46; The purpose of the Rebo&#39;s website would therefore be to provide millennials with a modern online platform to view upcoming events and book tickets&#46;</p>

                            <h3>Branding</h3>
                            <p>I started branding by sketching out a few logo ideas. Theoretically, this logo would be displayed outside of the club as a neon sign as well as on the website. Therefore, it needed to scale well to fit both scenarios. This also inspired the colour scheme consisting of blue with yellow as an accent colour. Some inspiration was also drawn from the art deco movement, particularly with the yellow tagline of the final logo and buttons throughout the website.</p>
                            <p>Poppins was chosen as the brand typeface for its legibility and flexibility. Additionally, the uppercase ‘J’ somewhat resembles the shape of a saxophone while I felt was a nice touch.</p>

                            <p>The sitemap allowed me to determine the structure of the website as well as the labels used throughout its navigation&#46; It was important for these labels to be as clear as possible so that there no unwanted surprises for any less tech&#45;savy users&#46; For example&#44; &#39;Food Menu&#39; is used instead of just &#39;Menu&#39; to avoid the link being mistaken for a website menu&#46;</p>

                            <p>Wireframes for every page were drawn on paper first in order to quickly determine the basic layout of the website. Naturally, a mobile first approach was taken to prioritise the content and visual hierarchy. Following this, I began work on the prototype, starting with a mid-fidelity mock-up.</p>
                            <p>From this mock-up, further amendments were made, particularly to the ‘Events’ page as explained in the next section.</p>

                            <p>Originally, upcoming events would be shown by month with arrows that could be used to navigate through each month. There were two problems with this approach. First was that in some months, there will be five Saturdays rather than four, meaning the layout would suffer. Secondly, the arrow navigation presented a significant user experience issue. This was because they would require multiple clicks to navigate through multiple months, resulting an a rather tedious experience.</p>
                            <p>To remedy these issues, I decided to replace the arrow navigation with a dropdown menu. This menu would allow users to filter upcoming events by month which are now all displayed at once by default.</p>
